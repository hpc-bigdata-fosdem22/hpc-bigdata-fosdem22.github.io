We invite presenters to submit talk proposals to present high-quality work with sufficient background
material to be clear to the HPC, Big Data, and/or Data Science communities.
Talk proposals should be submitted through the [FOSDEM Pentabarf
server](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM22).
Submissions must include:

- Abstract (plain text, couple of paragraps)
- Session type
- Session length
- Expected prior knowledge / intended audience
- Speaker bio
- Links to code / slides / material for the talk (optional)
- Links to previous talks by the speaker

Our intention is to have a series of talks of about 20 minutes each, with an additional 5-10 minutes for questions by attendees.

We would also like to note:

- All accepted talks will be about (using) free and open source software.<br/>We highly discourage "marketing" talks.
- Due to the online format of FOSDEM'22, <strong>accepted talks will have to be pre-recorded.</strong>
- Final presentations, including recording, will be <strong>due by mid January 2022</strong>.
- A devroom volunteer will work together with the speaker to ensure a high-quality recording is available in time.
- Talks will be <strong>streamed at the planned time slot during the weekend of Sat-Sunday 5-6 February 2022</strong> (following Brussels time).
- <strong>Speakers are expected to join their session for live Q&A with attendees after the talk.</strong>
