We are proud to announce the 7th edition of the HPC, Big Data and Data Science devroom at FOSDEM 2022.
The devroom is organized by representatives from the HPC and Big Data communities, who are joining forces to bring both communities together.

The devroom will take place *online* during the weekend of 5-6 Feb 2022,
and is open for everybody to join (no registration required).

Join us to enjoy a variety of talks, demos and interesting discussions on open-source HPC, Big Data and Data Science.


Sounds interesting? Submit your talk proposal and see you (virtually) at FOSDEM'22!

Submissions are light weight: basically talk title + short description, plain text.
Accepted talks will need to be pre-recorded by mid Jan'22.
